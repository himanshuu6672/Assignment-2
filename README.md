# Python Beginner Projects

This repository contains two simple Python programs designed for beginners to understand basic **conditionals** and **loops** in Python.

1. **Odd or Even Checker** (`Task 1.py`)
2. **Sum of Integers from 1 to 50** (`Task 2.py`)

---

## 1. Odd or Even Checker (`Task 1.py`)

### Functionality
This program asks the user to enter a number.  
It then checks if the number is divisible by 2:  
- If divisible, the program prints that the number is **Even**.  
- Otherwise, it prints that the number is **Odd**.  

### Code
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, "is an Even Number.")
else:
    print(num, "is an Odd Number.")
```

## 2. Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 (`Task 2.py`)

### Functionality
This program calculates the **sum of all integers from 1 to 50** using a loop.  
It starts from 0, adds each number one by one, and finally prints the total result.  

### Code
```python
a = 0

for i in range(51):
    a = a + i

print("The sum of numbers from 0 to 50 is:", a)
```

### Example Run

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where the scripts are saved.
3. Run the scripts using:
   ```bash
   python Task\ 1.py
   ```
   ```bash
   python Task\ 2.py
   ```

âœ¨ These projects demonstrate basic **decision-making (if-else)** and **iteration (for loops)** in Python.  
They are ideal for beginners to understand how programs interact with user input and perform simple calculations.
